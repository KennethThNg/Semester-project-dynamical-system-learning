# Semester-project-dynamical-system-learning
This project conssits of learning a dynamical systems. The project is composed of the following folder:

- ``VaeNeuralODE.ipynb``: contains the progression of the project.
- ``DynamicalSystemLayer.py``: contains the building of the dynamical system layers.
- ``VaeNeuralODELayer.py``: contains the different structure of the VaeNeuralODE.
- ``utiils.py`` : contains training process
- ``models.py`` : containts models build with the build layers 
- ``simple_pendulum.ipynb``: contains test for pendulum data
