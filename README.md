# Semester-project-dynamical-system-learning
This the semester project accomplish during the period of fall 2019. The topic of the project consists into buiding a layer of neural network for times series forecasting. We test if the model can learn exsting dynamical systems, then we analyze its behaviour with respect to noise.

## Libraries
Pytorch version 1.1.0
Pandas version 0.25.3
